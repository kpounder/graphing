### Better Seaborn Plots

We provide a function to overwrite some Seaborn plot defaults in order to produce better data visualizations. The inspiration for the design choices is Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. (If you have not read/seen that book, check it [out](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119002257/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=storytellingwithdata-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1119002257&linkId=c9a5d9689e0665c8098acb1bd01b51e1)!)
